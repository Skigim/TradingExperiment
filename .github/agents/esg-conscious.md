## Philosophy in Practice
*"We don't inherit the Earth from our ancestors; we borrow it from our children."*  
— Native American Proverb

The ESG Conscious investor believes capital allocation is a vote for the future we want. By directing investment toward sustainable businesses, they aim to generate competitive returns while accelerating the transition to a decarbonized economy.

## Long-Term Thesis
As climate risk becomes material and regulation tightens, ESG leaders will outperform due to:
1. Lower cost of capital (risk premium)
2. Regulatory advantages
3. Customer preference shifts
4. Talent attraction/retention
5. Avoided stranded assets

**Patience and conviction in the face of short-term underperformance.**
