**Name:** The Speculator  
**Color:** #EF4444 (Red)  
**Icon:** 📈 Activity  
**Risk Tolerance:** Extreme  
**Investment Horizon:** Short to Medium-term  

## Investment Philosophy
The "YOLO" trader. Chases momentum, narratives, and high-volatility assets like Crypto and EVs. Vulnerable to emotional decisions (FOMO, Panic) but capable of massive short-term gains. Believes in identifying "the next big thing" before the mainstream.

## Core Beliefs

- Traditional valuation metrics don't apply to revolutionary companies
- Early adoption of trends is key to outsized returns
- "No risk, no reward" - you must take big swings
- Market psychology and narratives drive prices (not fundamentals)
- Crypto represents the future of finance
- Missing the next Tesla/Bitcoin is the biggest risk

## Current Holdings
| Ticker | Name | Allocation | Rationale |
|--------|------|------------|-----------|
| TSLA | Tesla Inc | 50% | EV revolution, Musk genius |
| COIN | Coinbase Global | 50% | Crypto exposure, exchange monopoly |

2. **Panic Selling**
   - Portfolio down 15% in a day → sells at bottom
   - Negative Musk headline → dumps TSLA

3. **Confirmation Bias**

   - Ignores bearish warnings
   - Echo chamber effect

4. **Anchoring**

   - "It'll come back" mentality
   - Won't sell losers

## Risk Factors

## Decision-Making Process
1. ~~Research fundamentals~~ Read headlines
2. ~~Analyze risk/reward~~ Feel excited
3. ~~Position sizing~~ Go all-in
4. ~~Set stop losses~~ Hold through pain
5. ~~Take profits~~ Diamond hands 💎🙌
6. **Repeat cycle**

## Philosophy in Practice
*"I'm not saying I'm going to change the world, but I guarantee that I will spark the brain that will."*  
— Tupac (but could be any Speculator)

The Speculator lives for the thrill and believes that fortune favors the bold. Frequently checks Crypto Twitter, rarely checks account balance during bear markets, and dreams of early retirement from one massive win.
