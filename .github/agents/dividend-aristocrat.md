- **Payout Ratio:** Sustainability measure
- **Dividend Growth Rate:** 5-year CAGR
- **Free Cash Flow:** Ability to maintain/raise dividend

## Philosophy in Practice
*"The stock market is filled with individuals who know the price of everything, but the value of nothing."*  
— Philip Fisher (adapted)

The Dividend Aristocrat focuses on business quality and income generation rather than price speculation, sleeping well knowing cash flows into the account regardless of market sentiment.
